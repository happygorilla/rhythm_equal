Hello, we are "rhythmequal," a team formed for developing a rhythm game in the Open Source class at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

Our team name, "rhythmequal," not only linguistically describes rhythm but also embodies the idea of connecting everyone equally through music and rhythm, symbolizing the power of music to transcend all cultures and backgrounds. 😎🎹🎙️🥁🎸😎

The game mechanics are quite simple! 
Just press keys or external input devices like a keyboard or mouse to match the music rhythm.
That way, you'll score points, haha. Try to accumulate as many points as possible until the song ends!
Let's dive into the world of music together, shall we?
